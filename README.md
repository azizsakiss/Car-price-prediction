    Car-price-prediction
    
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict car prices based on their characteristics (make, fuel type, body style, engine size, horsepower, etc.).

We compare multiple regression models such as:

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

We used a classification model such as:

Random Forest Classifier

The goal is to evaluate which model gives the most accurate predictions and visualize the results.

    Technologies Used
    
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

XGBoost

    Workflow
    
Data Loading & Cleaning

Handle missing values

Encode categorical features (One Hot Encoding)

Normalize numerical features (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize distributions

Correlation analysis

Scatter plots of price vs features

    Model Training

Train Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor models for regression and Random Forest Classifier for classification.

Compare performance using evaluation metrics

Evaluation Metrics

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)

    Visualization

Plot predicted vs actual prices

Compare models side by side

    ðŸ“ˆ Results
    
Based on the regression results, Random Forest Regressor generally gives better performance (lower RMSE, higher RÂ²). The classification model also shows good accuracy.

Visualizations show predictions close to the ideal diagonal line (y = x) for the regression models and a clear separation of classes in the confusion matrix for the classification model.
